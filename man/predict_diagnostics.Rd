\usage{
predict_diagnostics(
  explainer,
  new_observation,
  variables = NULL,
  ...,
  nbins = 20,
  neighbors = 50,
  distance = gower::gower_dist
)

  explainer,
  new_observation,
  variables = NULL,
  ...,
  nbins = 20,

  distance = gower::gower_dist
)
}
\arguments{
\item{explainer}{a model to be explained, preprocessed by the 'explain' function}

\item{new_observation}{a new observation for which predictions need to be explained}

\item{variables}{character - name of variables to be explained}

\item{...}{other parameters}

\item{nbins}{number of bins for the histogram. By default 20}

\item{neighbors}{number of neighbors for histogram. By default 50.}

\item{distance}{the distance function, by default the \code{gower_dist()} function.}
}
\value{
An object of the class 'predict_diagnostics'.
It's a data frame with calculated distribution of residuals.
}
\description{
This function performs local diagnostic of residuals.
For a single instance its neighbors are identified in the validation data.
Residuals are calculated for neighbors and plotted against residuals for all data.
