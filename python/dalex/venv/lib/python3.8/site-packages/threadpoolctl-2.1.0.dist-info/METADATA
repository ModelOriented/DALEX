# Thread-pool Controls [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/_apis/build/status/joblib.threadpoolctl?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/joblib/threadpoolctl/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/joblib/threadpoolctl)

Python helpers to limit the number of threads used in the
threadpool-backed of common native libraries used for scientific
computing and data science (e.g. BLAS and OpenMP).

Fine control of the underlying thread-pool size can be useful in
workloads that involve nested parallelism so as to mitigate
oversubscription issues.

## Installation

- For users, install the last published version from PyPI:

  ```bash
  pip install threadpoolctl
  ```

- For contributors, install from the source repository in developer
  mode:

  ```bash
  pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
  flit install --symlink
  ```

  then you run the tests with pytest:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Get a JSON description of thread-pools initialized when importing python
packages such as numpy or scipy for instance:

```
python -m threadpoolctl -i numpy scipy.linalg
[
  {
    "filepath": "/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so",
    "prefix": "libmkl_rt",
    "user_api": "blas",
    "internal_api": "mkl",
    "version": "2019.0.4",
    "num_threads": 2,
    "threading_layer": "intel"
  },
  {
    "filepath": "/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so",
    "prefix": "libiomp",
    "user_api": "openmp",
    "internal_api": "openmp",
    "version": null,
    "num_threads": 4
  }
]
```

The JSON information is written on STDOUT. If some of the packages are missing,
a warning message is displayed on STDERR.

### Python Runtime Programmatic Introspection

Introspect the current state of the threadpool-enabled runtime libraries
that are loaded when importing Python packages:

```python
>>> from threadpoolctl import threadpool_info
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> pprint(threadpool_info())
[]

>>> import numpy
>>> pprint(threadpool_info())
[{'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so',
  'internal_api': 'mkl',
  'num_threads': 2,
  'prefix': 'libmkl_rt',
  'threading_layer': 'intel',
  'user_api': 'blas',
  'version': '2019.0.4'},
 {'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so',
  'internal_api': 'openmp',
  'num_threads': 4,
  'prefix': 'libiomp',
  'user_api': 'openmp',
  'version': None}]

>>> import xgboost
>>> pprint(threadpool_info())
[{'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libmkl_rt.so',
  'internal_api': 'mkl',
  'num_threads': 2,
  'prefix': 'libmkl_rt',
  'threading_layer': 'intel',
  'user_api': 'blas',
  'version': '2019.0.4'},
 {'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libiomp5.so',
  'internal_api': 'openmp',
  'num_threads': 4,
  'prefix': 'libiomp',
  'user_api': 'openmp',
  'version': None},
 {'filepath': '/home/ogrisel/miniconda3/envs/tmp/lib/libgomp.so.1.0.0',
  'internal_api': 'openmp',
  'num_threads': 4,
  'prefix': 'libgomp',
  'user_api': 'openmp',
  'version': None}]
```

In the above example, `numpy` was installed from the default anaconda channel and
comes with the MKL and its Intel OpenMP (`libiomp5`) implementation while
`xgboost` was installed from pypi.org and links against GNU OpenMP (`libgomp`)
so both OpenMP runtimes are loaded in the same Python program.

### Setting the Maximum Size of Thread-Pools

Control the number of threads used by the underlying runtime libraries
in specific sections of your Python program:

```python
from threadpoolctl import threadpool_limits
import numpy as np


with threadpool_limits(limits=1, user_api='blas'):
    # In this block, calls to blas implementation (like openblas or MKL)
    # will be limited to use only one thread. They can thus be used jointly
    # with thread-parallelism.
    a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000)
    a_squared = a @ a
```

### Known Limitations

- `threadpool_limits` can fail to limit the number of inner threads when nesting
  parallel loops managed by distinct OpenMP runtime implementations (for instance
  libgomp from GCC and libomp from clang/llvm or libiomp from ICC).

  See the `test_openmp_nesting` function in [tests/test_threadpoolctl.py](
  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/tests/test_threadpoolctl.py)
  for an example. More information can be found at:
  https://github.com/jeremiedbb/Nested_OpenMP

  Note however that this problem does not happen when `threadpool_limits` is
  used to limit the number of threads used internally by BLAS calls that are
  themselves nested under OpenMP parallel loops. `threadpool_limits` works as
  expected, even if the inner BLAS implementation relies on a distinct OpenMP
  implementation.

- Using Intel OpenMP (ICC) and LLVM OpenMP (clang) in the same Python program
  under Linux is known to cause problems. See the following guide for more details
  and workarounds:
  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/blob/master/multiple_openmp.md


## Maintainers

To make a release:

Bump the version number (`__version__`) in `threadpoolctl.py`.

Build the distribution archives:

```bash
pip install flit
flit build
```

Check the contents of `dist/`.

If everything is fine, make a commit for the release, tag it, push the
tag to github and then:

```bash
flit publish
```

### Credits

The initial dynamic library introspection code was written by @anton-malakhov
for the smp package available at https://github.com/IntelPython/smp .

threadpoolctl extends this for other operationg systems. Contrary to smp,
threadpoolctl does not attempt to limit the size of Python multiprocessing
pools (threads or processes) or set operating system-level CPU affinity
constraints: threadpoolctl only interacts with native libraries via their
public runtime APIs.
