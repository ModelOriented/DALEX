            align
                Sets the horizontal alignment of the `text`
                within the box. Has an effect only if `text`
                spans two or more lines (i.e. `text` contains
                one or more <br> HTML tags) or if an explicit
                width is set to override the text width.
            arrowcolor
                Sets the color of the annotation arrow.
            arrowhead
                Sets the end annotation arrow head style.
            arrowside
                Sets the annotation arrow head position.
            arrowsize
                Sets the size of the end annotation arrow head,
                relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1
                (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the
                line.
            arrowwidth
                Sets the width (in px) of annotation arrow
                line.
            ax
                Sets the x component of the arrow tail about
                the arrow head. If `axref` is `pixel`, a
                positive (negative)  component corresponds to
                an arrow pointing from right to left (left to
                right). If `axref` is an axis, this is an
                absolute value on that axis, like `x`, NOT a
                relative value.
            axref
                Indicates in what terms the tail of the
                annotation (ax,ay)  is specified. If `pixel`,
                `ax` is a relative offset in pixels  from `x`.
                If set to an x axis id (e.g. "x" or "x2"), `ax`
                is  specified in the same terms as that axis.
                This is useful  for trendline annotations which
                should continue to indicate  the correct trend
                when zoomed.
            ay
                Sets the y component of the arrow tail about
                the arrow head. If `ayref` is `pixel`, a
                positive (negative)  component corresponds to
                an arrow pointing from bottom to top (top to
                bottom). If `ayref` is an axis, this is an
                absolute value on that axis, like `y`, NOT a
                relative value.
            ayref
                Indicates in what terms the tail of the
                annotation (ax,ay)  is specified. If `pixel`,
                `ay` is a relative offset in pixels  from `y`.
                If set to a y axis id (e.g. "y" or "y2"), `ay`
                is  specified in the same terms as that axis.
                This is useful  for trendline annotations which
                should continue to indicate  the correct trend
                when zoomed.
            bgcolor
                Sets the background color of the annotation.
            bordercolor
                Sets the color of the border enclosing the
                annotation `text`.
            borderpad
                Sets the padding (in px) between the `text` and
                the enclosing border.
            borderwidth
                Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing
                the annotation `text`.
            captureevents
                Determines whether the annotation text box
                captures mouse move and click events, or allows
                those events to pass through to data points in
                the plot that may be behind the annotation. By
                default `captureevents` is False unless
                `hovertext` is provided. If you use the event
                `plotly_clickannotation` without `hovertext`
                you must explicitly enable `captureevents`.
            clicktoshow
                Makes this annotation respond to clicks on the
                plot. If you click a data point that exactly
                matches the `x` and `y` values of this
                annotation, and it is hidden (visible: false),
                it will appear. In "onoff" mode, you must click
                the same point again to make it disappear, so
                if you click multiple points, you can show
                multiple annotations. In "onout" mode, a click
                anywhere else in the plot (on another data
                point or not) will hide this annotation. If you
                need to show/hide this annotation in response
                to different `x` or `y` values, you can set
                `xclick` and/or `yclick`. This is useful for
                example to label the side of a bar. To label
                markers though, `standoff` is preferred over
                `xclick` and `yclick`.
            font
                Sets the annotation text font.
            height
                Sets an explicit height for the text box. null
                (default) lets the text set the box height.
                Taller text will be clipped.
            hoverlabel
                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.annotation.
                Hoverlabel` instance or dict with compatible
                properties
            hovertext
                Sets text to appear when hovering over this
                annotation. If omitted or blank, no hover label
                will appear.
            name
                When used in a template, named items are
                created in the output figure in addition to any
                items the figure already has in this array. You
                can modify these items in the output figure by
                making your own item with `templateitemname`
                matching this `name` alongside your
                modifications (including `visible: false` or
                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect
                outside of a template.
            opacity
                Sets the opacity of the annotation (text +
                arrow).
            showarrow
                Determines whether or not the annotation is
                drawn with an arrow. If True, `text` is placed
                near the arrow's tail. If False, `text` lines
                up with the `x` and `y` provided.
            standoff
                Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end
                arrowhead away from the position it is pointing
                at, for example to point at the edge of a
                marker independent of zoom. Note that this
                shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay` vector,
                in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves
                everything by this amount.
            startarrowhead
                Sets the start annotation arrow head style.
            startarrowsize
                Sets the size of the start annotation arrow
                head, relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1
                (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the
                line.
            startstandoff
                Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the start
                arrowhead away from the position it is pointing
                at, for example to point at the edge of a
                marker independent of zoom. Note that this
                shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay` vector,
                in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves
                everything by this amount.
            templateitemname
                Used to refer to a named item in this array in
                the template. Named items from the template
                will be created even without a matching item in
                the input figure, but you can modify one by
                making an item with `templateitemname` matching
                its `name`, alongside your modifications
                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false`
                to hide it). If there is no template or no
                matching item, this item will be hidden unless
                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`.
            text
                Sets the text associated with this annotation.
                Plotly uses a subset of HTML tags to do things
                like newline (<br>), bold (<b></b>), italics
                (<i></i>), hyperlinks (<a href='...'></a>).
                Tags <em>, <sup>, <sub> <span> are also
                supported.
            textangle
                Sets the angle at which the `text` is drawn
                with respect to the horizontal.
            valign
                Sets the vertical alignment of the `text`
                within the box. Has an effect only if an
                explicit height is set to override the text
                height.
            visible
                Determines whether or not this annotation is
                visible.
            width
                Sets an explicit width for the text box. null
                (default) lets the text set the box width.
                Wider text will be clipped. There is no
                automatic wrapping; use <br> to start a new
                line.
            x
                Sets the annotation's x position. If the axis
                `type` is "log", then you must take the log of
                your desired range. If the axis `type` is
                "date", it should be date strings, like date
                data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds
                will be accepted and converted to strings. If
                the axis `type` is "category", it should be
                numbers, using the scale where each category is
                assigned a serial number from zero in the order
                it appears.
            xanchor
                Sets the text box's horizontal position anchor
                This anchor binds the `x` position to the
                "left", "center" or "right" of the annotation.
                For example, if `x` is set to 1, `xref` to
                "paper" and `xanchor` to "right" then the
                right-most portion of the annotation lines up
                with the right-most edge of the plotting area.
                If "auto", the anchor is equivalent to "center"
                for data-referenced annotations or if there is
                an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no
                arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the
                closest side.
            xclick
                Toggle this annotation when clicking a data
                point whose `x` value is `xclick` rather than
                the annotation's `x` value.
            xref
                Sets the annotation's x coordinate axis. If set
                to an x axis id (e.g. "x" or "x2"), the `x`
                position refers to an x coordinate If set to
                "paper", the `x` position refers to the
                distance from the left side of the plotting
                area in normalized coordinates where 0 (1)
                corresponds to the left (right) side.
            xshift
                Shifts the position of the whole annotation and
                arrow to the right (positive) or left
                (negative) by this many pixels.
            y
                Sets the annotation's y position. If the axis
                `type` is "log", then you must take the log of
                your desired range. If the axis `type` is
                "date", it should be date strings, like date
                data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds
                will be accepted and converted to strings. If
                the axis `type` is "category", it should be
                numbers, using the scale where each category is
                assigned a serial number from zero in the order
                it appears.
            yanchor
                Sets the text box's vertical position anchor
                This anchor binds the `y` position to the
                "top", "middle" or "bottom" of the annotation.
                For example, if `y` is set to 1, `yref` to
                "paper" and `yanchor` to "top" then the top-
                most portion of the annotation lines up with
                the top-most edge of the plotting area. If
                "auto", the anchor is equivalent to "middle"
                for data-referenced annotations or if there is
                an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no
                arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the
                closest side.
            yclick
                Toggle this annotation when clicking a data
                point whose `y` value is `yclick` rather than
                the annotation's `y` value.
            yref
                Sets the annotation's y coordinate axis. If set
                to an y axis id (e.g. "y" or "y2"), the `y`
                position refers to an y coordinate If set to
                "paper", the `y` position refers to the
                distance from the bottom of the plotting area
                in normalized coordinates where 0 (1)
                corresponds to the bottom (top).
            yshift
                Shifts the position of the whole annotation and
                arrow up (positive) or down (negative) by this
                many pixels.
