#' Human Resources Data
#'
#' Datasets \code{HR} and \code{HRTest} are artificial, generated form the same model.
#' Structure of the dataset is based on a real data, from Human Resources department with
#' information which employees were promoted, which were fired.
#'
#' Values are generated in a way to:
#' - have interaction between age and gender for the 'fired' variable
#' - have non monotonic relation for the salary variable
#' - have linear effects for hours and evaluation.
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item gender - gender of an employee.
#' \item age - gender of an employee in the moment of evaluation.
#' \item hours - average number of working hours per week.
#' \item evaluation - evaluation in the scale 2 (bad) - 5 (very good).
#' \item salary - level of salary in the scale 0 (lowest) - 5 (highest).
#' \item status - target variable, either `fired` or `promoted` or `ok`.
